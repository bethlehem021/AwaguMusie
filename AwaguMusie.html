    <p>Awagu E. Musie was born in Gojjam, Ethiopia where she was raised by her grandparents
    till she was 12 years old till she was forced to flee her homeland due to political/communist conflict.
    She trekked for over seventeen days, barefoot with no food or water,
    till she reached Sudan where she lived in camps as a refugee till she reached the age of around 18 years.
    She was then “sponsored” by the Red Cross to seek political asylum here in the U.S. where she
    did nothing short of built the best life that she could for herself and her family.</p>

    <p>Musie never took “no” for an answer.
      She was always willing to go the ends of the Earth for people, even those she just barely knew.
      She was a “Warrior of Truth” as many continue to call her.
      She was the glue that kept many families and communities together and even in her passing,
      she continues to shine her light as she “guides” the way.</p>

      <p>Awagu was a woman determined to prove the world wrong. As someone who had all of the odds set against her by default,
        she took her lows and turned them into “ways”. Ways to find and do better.
        She was so set in making sure that she lived the best like that she could,
        that she never got the chance to stop and see how many people she influenced along the way.
        She started her life in America as a housekeeper, then worked in a factory molding blades for Gillette,
        then onto being a single stay-at-home mother, then on to putting all that she could into franchising a Dollar Store
        all on her own while still keeping her hospital housekeeping position,
        all till she was tragically told that her life would possibly soon come to an end due to
        medical personnel misdiagnosing her years long silent battle with stage 3/4 breast cancer.</p>

        <p>There was no question or hesitation as to what my siblings and I wanted placed on our Mother’s tombstone.
          “Climb The Hill” was her was of being a constant reminder to us (and many others alike in the Ethiopian-American community)
           that nothing comes easily, but keeping the effort and reminding yourself that it is all about the journey was/is in fact
           what it’s all about. She always reiterated that despite the trek, the view in at the top of the hill is all and ever
           entirely worth it.</p>
